# Memoize Function

This repository is about a memoize function, where a code is executed that validates the execution speed of a function and its cache, and returns the fastest between them.



## First steps

 in order to run into your local machine, you must follow the follogin steps
 

 **ðŸ“‘  Requeriments**

you must install the last version of NPM and node

you can check if you have installed the last verions of this of NPM and node using the followwing commands

## time to run the app

once all it's installed, and in your terminal you must run the following code: npm run develop

the app will be up and ready to test

## how can test it?

you must put into your browser the following address:
http://localhost:8081/

and put in the last part of the address a query params

example: http://localhost:8081/id=1

where id is the params that the app's receive and the number is the ID character of the Rick &  Morty API

This will return the information of the character and you will see in your terminal a console message, where it will tell you which was faster between the function or the cache memory, and the time in milliseconds that each one took
